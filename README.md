# Quiz-app
# This is a project I created on my free time through the use of php and html. The application main function is to create accounts with the roles of teacher and student. Furthermore, the teachers are able to questions that can then be assigned to quizzes. The quizzes can then be completed by students. Teachers can grade and view the student submissions. Students can see their marks while teachers are able to see all student marks. Students have limited functions throughout the site while teachers have access to everything.
